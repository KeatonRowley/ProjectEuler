Main features:

 Frame Energy • Frame Intensity / Loudness (approximation) • Critical Band spectra (Mel/Bark/Octave, triangular masking ﬁlters) • Mel-/Bark-Frequency-Cepstral Coeﬃcients (MFCC) • Auditory Spectra • Loudness approximated from auditory spectra. • Perceptual Linear Predictive (PLP) Coeﬃcients • Perceptual Linear Predictive Cepstral Coeﬃcients (PLP-CC) • Linear Predictive Coeﬃcients (LPC) • Line Spectral Pairs (LSP, aka. LSF) • Fundamental Frequency (via ACF/Cepstrum method and via Subharmonic-Summation (SHS))
• Probability of Voicing from ACF and SHS spectrum peak • Voice-Quality: Jitter and Shimmer • Formant frequencies and bandwidths • Zero- and Mean-Crossing rate • Spectral features (arbitrary band energies, roll-oﬀ points, centroid, entropy, maxpos, minpos, variance (=spread), skewness, kurtosis, slope)
• Psychoacoustic sharpness, spectral harmonicity • CHROMA (octave warped semitone spectra) and CENS features (energy normalised and smoothed CHROMA)
• CHROMA-derived Features for Chord and Key recognition

Chroma = computes musical chroma features (for 12 semi-tines)

MFCC = for speach recognition
MFCC12 = extracts Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients 

PLP = plp cepstral coefficients

Prosodic features = extract fundemental frequency, voicing probability, loudness countours 

emobase = old baseline set 988 acoustic features for emotion recognition
emo_large = larger feature set more functionals & more LLD
emobase2010 = based INTER-SPEECH 2010 paralinguistic challenge feature set
	582 features. 34 low-level descriptors, 34 corresponding delta coefficients, 21 functionals, 4 pitch-based LLD, four delta coefficient contours, pitch onsets
